            The stackoverflow-error is one of the most common errors in programming. To understand what it means one must first understand stack. A stack is a specific amount of empty memory asked for by a particular method. When the method runs it fills up the stack-memory and uses the space it needs to run. Once the method stops to run it is no longer using the space. So when the method no longer runs the stack memory is no longer being used.

              <br>
            The stack overflow-error is triggered when the stack memory isnt sufficent to run the particular action asked for. This happens when one is programming a recurring function, method or loop that either fills up to much space on the stack, or when the coding of the ”end” of either of this functions is missing or incorrect (accidental or intentional). When a funcion, method or loop dont have a correct ending it will keep recurring or calling itself over and over again, which makes the action infinitely longer. This will lead to the stackoverflow-error. In other word one can describe it as the stackoverflow-error as an error one will get when trying to program an action that will take up more space than the memory available for it.

            As mentioned before the stackoverload error is very common in programming. A way to avoid it is to always go trough methods and functions that calls and loop themselfes to make sure that they have a correct end-value, so that they dont keep on calling themselfes. Another tip is that if you program a method that might take up too much space, try to narow it down as much as possible.

If one sign up to the community you can ask programming-related questions to other users and also see what others berfore you have asked about the same topic.
